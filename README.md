# 🌊 Luma: Real-Time Flood Forecast and Response System for Africa

Luma is a context-aware, real-time flood forecasting and response platform built for low-resource settings in Africa. It provides actionable flood alerts to individuals, and enables agencies (e.g., NEMA, NGOs, local governments) to monitor flood-prone regions, assess damage, and coordinate relief efforts more efficiently.

---

## 🌍 Why Luma?

Unforeseen weather conditions are increasingly disrupting lives across Africa:

- **Smallholder farmers in Nigeria** face crop destruction from flash floods.
- **Communities in Kenya, Burundi, and Tanzania** suffer infrastructure damage and landslides.
- **National agencies** struggle with vague, non-contextual forecasts and lack the tools to deploy timely, localized responses.

Luma was born out of the need to address these gaps with:
- **Localized flood forecasts**
- **Real-time alerts**
- **Damage assessment**
- **AI-powered response advisory**

---

## 🚀 What It Does

Luma combines satellite data, local environmental inputs, and machine learning to power a smart, multi-layered system that delivers:

### 👤 For Users (e.g., farmers, landlords, commuters):
- Personalized alerts based on **proximity to flood-risk zones**
- In-device, **real-time risk tracking** (even offline)
- Guidance to help **evacuate safely** and avoid re-entering risk zones

### 🧑‍💼 For Clients (e.g., NEMA, NGOs, LGAs):
- A web dashboard for **real-time monitoring**
- **Damage extent analytics** from satellite imagery
- **Contextual AI-generated strategies** to prioritize response and relief

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Luma is built around three core layers:

### 📡 1. **Data Layer**
- Sources data from:
  - Sentinel-1 & Sentinel-2 satellites
  - Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.)
  - Geo-coordinates from mobile devices
- Converts raw data into lightweight **GeoJSON** formats
- Optimized for **low bandwidth** delivery

### ⚙️ 2. **Processor Layer**
- Receives continuous updates from the Data Layer
- Performs:
  - Real-time **risk computation**
  - **Mobile-side processing** for local decision-making
  - Triggering of alerts to users and clients
- Uses asynchronous syncs and **offline-first logic** to handle poor connectivity

### 🤖 3. **Machine Learning (ML) Layer**
- Learns from past flood patterns and current risks
- Offers:
  - Predictive flood modeling
  - **Context-specific advice** (e.g., where to send relief, when to evacuate)
  - Generates insights for agencies based on **retrieved history and real-time inputs**

## 🔄 Working Principle

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Processor Layer constantly checks incoming data.
2. **Risk Prioritization**: Locations are ranked by risk levels.
3. **Alert System**: Users receive mobile notifications, clients get dashboard alerts.
4. **Edge Computing**: Local devices calculate real-time flood proximity and safety paths.
5. **Feedback Loop**: ML Layer adapts to data trends to improve advisory outputs.

**Example:**  
A user in a flood-risk area gets an alert and evacuates. Luma continues tracking to ensure their destination is not within another risk radius—**a key improvement over traditional systems**.

## 💬 Communication & Optimization

| Layer            | Optimization Strategy |
|------------------|------------------------|
| **Data Layer**   | Sends GeoJSON not full raster maps. Lightweight and fast. |
| **Processor**    | Works offline. Uses Twilio SMS for ultra-low bandwidth alerts. |
| **UI Layer**     | Minimal UI. Progressive rendering based on device capability. |
| **ML Layer**     | Async processing. Cached context-aware models. Reduces request load. |

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript (React), TypeScript
- **Satellite Sources:** Copernicus Sentinel-1 & Sentinel-2
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Docker
- **Frontend:** Leaflet.js + WebSocket + Progressive Web App (PWA)
- **Machine Learning:** PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- **Alerting:** Twilio SMS, Push Notifications
- **Storage:** Cloud buckets + Edge caching
- **Dashboards:** Custom-built analytics panel for agencies

---

## 📊 Sample Use Case: Emergency Response

1. Heavy rainfall is detected by satellite + environmental sensors.
2. Processor Layer flags regions exceeding flood threshold.
3. A farmer in the North receives an alert with a heat map of risk radius.
4. NEMA is alerted via dashboard, and receives a suggested relief strategy.
5. Post-event, flood extent is mapped using damage assessment ML tools.
6. Relief teams are directed to **precise coordinates** where help is most needed.
